This game is created for the master thesis by Luuk van den Nouweland, university of Leiden.
Supervisor: Evert van Nieuwenburg

# Rules
In this game, multiple rules are implemented.
1. Classical: Normal checkers
2. Superpositions: Checkers where pieces can exist in superposition
3. Simple entanglement: Checkers where pieces can be entangled with each other, but entanglement with pieces that are entangled is not possible
4. Entanglement: Checkers with unlimited entanglement
